# TBKBot Pin Archiver Cog
This is just a fix on the original [Pin Archiver](https://github.com/HaiderZaidiDev/Discord-Pin-Archiver-Bot), rewriting the code in modern discord.py, turning all the @client.event functions into commands, and generally patching the functionality of the Pin Archiver bot. It's suggested you merge it into your own bot, however you don't have to. This bot was developed for the developer owned TBKBot for The Boundless Kingdom (our discord server.) 

# Requirements
